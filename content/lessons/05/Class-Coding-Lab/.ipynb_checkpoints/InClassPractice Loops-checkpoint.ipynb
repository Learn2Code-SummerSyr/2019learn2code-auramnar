    "A while loop is a construct that repeatedly executes an indented block of code as long as the loop's expression is True. At the end of the loop body, execution goes back to the while loop statement and the loop expression is evaluated again. If the loop expression is True, the loop body is executed again. But, if the expression evaluates to False, then execution instead proceeds to below the loop body.\n",
